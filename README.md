# 📊 Portfolio Project — SQL Data Analysis & Cleaning

This project is a data analytics portfolio showcase that demonstrates my ability to clean, transform, and explore real-world datasets using SQL. It includes work on COVID-19 data and housing datasets, focusing on building clean, reliable data for insights and decision-making.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Raw data often comes with duplicates, missing values, inconsistent formats, and errors. This project highlights how I use SQL to:

🧹 Clean messy datasets (remove duplicates, standardize data, fix inconsistencies)

🔍 Explore large datasets to extract meaningful insights

📈 Perform real-world analysis on COVID-19 deaths, vaccinations, and housing trends

🗄️ Transform raw data into analysis-ready formats for further use in dashboards or ML

This project is designed to showcase my data analytics skills and provide reusable SQL scripts for common cleaning and exploration tasks.

## 🛠️ Skills & Tools Showcased

SQL (Core Skill): Joins, CTEs, window functions, aggregation, cleaning queries

Data Cleaning: Identifying and fixing inconsistencies in real-world data

Data Analysis: Extracting insights and trends from structured datasets

Database Handling: Importing and managing .xlsx datasets into SQL databases

Problem Solving: Converting raw, messy datasets into structured, analysis-ready data

## 🎯 Services This Project Provides

✔️ Clean and reliable datasets ready for analysis or dashboards
✔️ SQL scripts for data cleaning workflows (reusable in future projects)
✔️ Insights into public health trends (COVID) and real estate (housing)
✔️ A practical demonstration of SQL proficiency for real-world analytics
✔️ A foundation for future BI dashboards, visualizations, or ML models

## ✅ Why This Project Matters

This project shows how I apply data analytics fundamentals in real-world scenarios:

Turning messy, raw data into valuable insights

Designing reusable SQL scripts that work on multiple datasets

Bridging the gap between raw data collection and business-ready insights

It highlights my ability to work with SQL end-to-end: from importing raw data → cleaning → transformation → analysis → preparing for visualization.
